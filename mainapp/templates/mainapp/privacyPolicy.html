                                    </ul>

                                    </ul>
                                 </li>

                              <p><strong>Age Limits</strong></p>
                              <p>If you are under 16 years of age and your AtEase account is not being linked to your GP practice with your GP’s authorisation, your parent or legal guardian must supervise the registration and use of your AtEase account at all times for any features made available to you as part of this service.

                              <p>As noted above, we sometimes use other organisations to process your personal data on our behalf, for example, in relation to analysis of the use of the Service and/or Booking Service.

You can find more information about your rights on the Information Commissioner’s Office website – please see <a href="https://ico.org.uk/for-the-public/">https://ico.org.uk/for-the-public/</a>.</p>
                              <p>We have outlined below the key rights which we believe may be relevant to your use of the Site, App, the Service and/or Booking Service.</p>
                              <p>If you would like to exercise any of these rights then please contact us using the contact information provided below. Please note that you may be asked to provide us with reasonable proof of your identity so that we can be sure that we are discussing or providing your personal data with, or to, you (or if someone is making a request on your behalf, we need to check that they have the authority to do so).</p>
                              <p><strong>Access to information</strong></p>
                              <p>You have the right to access certain information we hold about you so that you can be aware of, and verify the lawfulness of, the processing we undertake.</p>
                              <p>You can exercise your right of access by making what is generally referred to as a 'subject access request'.</p>
                              <p>We will review each request which we receive and if we agree that we are obliged to provide personal data to you then we will (subject to certain limited exceptions provided under the relevant law) amongst other things: (i) describe it to you; (ii) tell you why we are holding it; (iii) tell you who it could be disclosed to; and (iv) let you have a copy of it (this may include providing an electronic copy).</p>
                              <p><strong>Right to have information corrected</strong></p>
                              <p>If you identify that any personal data that we hold about you is wrong, inaccurate or out of date then you may ask us to correct or update it. Please contact us via the details provided below and we will review each request and respond accordingly.</p>
                              <p><strong>Right of erasure and the right to stop or limit our processing of your personal data</strong></p>

Alternatively, you can ask us to stop or to limit any processing we are undertaking in respect of your personal data. These rights arise if we no longer have a valid reason to do so or if we have held it for too long.</p>
                              <p>These are not absolute rights but every request we receive will be considered carefully and we will respond accordingly (providing grounds for any decision we make).</p>

Please note that not all uses which we make of your personal data require your consent (for example, if we need to use that information in order to provide a service you have requested then we do not need your consent in order to do so). If you choose to withdraw consent in respect of Health &amp; Fitness Data then you will no longer be able to use that functionality in respect of the Service.</p>

                              <p>An objection may be in relation to all of the personal data we hold (as a controller) about you or only to certain information. It may also only relate to a particular purpose we are processing the data for.</p>
                              <p>You have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes by following the opt-out links on any marketing message sent to you or by contacting us at any time.
